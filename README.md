üë©üèª‚Äçüíª **GitHub Actions workflow: [.github/workflows/wheels.yml](.github/workflows/wheels.yml)**

This repo provides daily builds of binary wheels for the Python [`google-cloud-profiler`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-profiler-python) library, for various Linux architectures.

A GitHub actions workflow checks every day if there is a new `google-cloud-profiler` release. If that is the case, it builds the binaries and uploads them in a new [release](https://github.com/pietrodn/cloud-profiler-python-wheels/releases).
